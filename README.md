Abstract:-

The Smart Doorbell project was an opportunity to explore remote monitoring and controlling of
devices. The Doorbell hardware was interfaced with the Raspberry Pi and the Pi was connected
to a Mobile App for remote monitoring and access control. The server script was written in
Python to stream video and audio to the Mobile App as well as receive audio from the App. The
sensor connected to the Pi was monitored for any motion and notification was sent to the App if
any motion was detected. The script also allowed the App to control the door lock.
The expected outcomes of the project were verified by transmitting video and audio from the Pi
and successfully receiving both video and audio on the Mobile App. The full duplex audio
communication was established between the Pi and the Mobile App. And it was verified by
initiating a simultaneous two-way audio communication between the Pi and the App. The door
lock operation was tested by remotely controlling it from the App. The motion sensor was
tested by triggering it and the notifications were received on the App. Overall, the Smart
Doorbell was working without any delays and the entire system was very responsive.
